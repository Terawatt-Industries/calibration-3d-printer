New fangled calibration parts for RepRap 3D Printers.  40mm X/Y cubes, 20mm tall, with an embedded X-axis marking.  Bigger pieces mean more accumulated error, which is what we want.  We recommend printing a plate of 9 of these, take 2 or 3 measurements of each cube, and finally calculate the average of all the measurements.  Instead of ignoring measurements that are outliers, include them and form an estimate of error - perhaps repeat the procedure.  See http://phys.columbia.edu/~tutorial/ for more information about getting started with error analysis.
