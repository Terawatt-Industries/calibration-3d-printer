Calibration parts for RepRap 3D Printers.  40mm X/Y cubes, 20mm tall, with an embedded X-axis marking.  There's a text logo for 40mm, and a notch on the X-axis (or y if you plate it like that).

Bigger pieces mean more accumulated error, which is exactly what we want to measure and take into consideration during calibration.  For example, we recommend printing a plate of 9 of these, take 2 or 3 measurements of each cube, and finally calculate the average of all the measurements.  Instead of ignoring measurements that are outliers, or immediately re-measuring, include them and form an estimate of error.  Perhaps repeat the procedure once or twice.

See http://phys.columbia.edu/~tutorial/ for more information about getting started with error analysis.

This part _should_ be designed in OpenSCAD and parameterized.  That's straightforward, but once we decided the part needed fancy-schmancy text the plan unraveled.  Imported text from Illustrator CS5 wouldn't work -- at all.  It seems that won't be supported anytime soon, if ever.  We tried to export 3D fonts from Sketchup into OpenSCAD.  However OpenSCAD didn't play nicely with the STL exports.  We performed a little verification that seems to indicate OpenSCAD is the culprit but we got out of that rabbit hole just-in-time.  Inkscape could do it, but we don't have Inkscape.  In a future revision we'd like to abandon the text, or fix it, and go back to SCAD.
